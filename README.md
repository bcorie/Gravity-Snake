# Gravity-Snake
Only source code, supplementary libraries are not included

## Console Only
Early stages of development to ensure the game works as intended. No graphics, but position of the snake in the world is displayed through the console.

## Console and Application
A slightly reworked version of the Console Only build. Some methods are supplied through a .dll instead of in a header file. This build features an interface with gameplay, a UI for score, and menus with controls and highscores.
